## ðŸš€ Plan

**Languages and Tools I'll be Rocking**:
- **VScode** - My Best Friend
- **Apache** - The web server that keeps the web running.
- **MySQL** - For all my database needs.
- **Git & GitHub** - For Version Control and collaboration.
- **PHP** - The backbone of my server-side scripting.
- **CSS** - My Web Page styler.
- **JavaScript** - The life bringer.
- **Composer** *(Future Plans)* - I haven't really tried this yet, but I will soon be!
- **Python** *(Future Plans)* - Still deciding, but I have big plans to integrate chatbots into my portfolio. Stay tuned!
