## ðŸš€ Plan

**Languages and Tools I'll be Rocking**:
1. **VScode** - My Best Friend
2. **Apache** - The web server that keeps the web running.
3. **MySQL** - For all my database needs.
4. **Git & GitHub** - For Version Control and collaboration.
5. **PHP** - The backbone of my server-side scripting.
6. **CSS** - My Web Page styler.
7. **JavaScript** - The life bringer.
8. **Composer** *(Future Plans)* - I haven't really tried this yet, but I will soon be!
9. **Python** *(Future Plans)* - Still deciding, but I have big plans to integrate chatbots into my portfolio. Stay tuned!
